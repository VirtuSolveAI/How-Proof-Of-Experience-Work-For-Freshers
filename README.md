VirtuSolveAI is a non-profit initiative, but we treat every project with professional standards. We ensure that every volunteer gains *real, verifiable experience* by working directly with early-stage startups.

###  How We Provide Proof of Experience

- *Public GitHub Contributions*  
  All work is tracked via commits and repositories under the VirtuSolveAI organization. This creates a visible record of each member’s contributions.

- *Startup Testimonials*  
  After completing a project, we encourage our client startups to provide short testimonials acknowledging your work and professionalism. These can be added to your LinkedIn, resume, or portfolio.

- *Experience Letters*  
  Upon request, VirtuSolveAI provides signed experience letters for volunteers detailing the scope of their work, technologies used, and impact delivered.

- *Portfolio-Ready Projects*  
  Volunteers are encouraged to write case studies, record demos, or maintain clean project READMEs — turning each collaboration into a strong portfolio asset.
